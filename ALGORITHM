TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM USING KRUSKALâ€™S MST 
ALGORITHM ANALYSIS :
1.	Start the program and read in the input graph. 
2.	Sort the edges in ascending order of their weights. 
3.	Initialize an empty set of edges for the MST. 
4.	Initialize a disjoint set for the nodes. 
5.	For each edge in the sorted list of edges: 
6.	Find the root of each node in the edge using path compression 
7.	If the nodes are in different sets, add the edge to the MST set and merge the two sets using union-by-rank. 
8.	Check if the MST is complete by comparing the number of edges in the MST set to the number of nodes minus one. 
9.	If the MST is complete, end the algorithm and return the MST set. 
10.	If the MST is not complete, continue with the next edge. 
11.	Delete edges that are unlikely to be part of the MST based on their weights. 
12.	Check if the algorithm should end by comparing the number of edges in the MST set to the number of nodes minus one. 
13.	If the algorithm should end, end the program. 
14.	Otherwise, repeat steps 5 to 12 until the MST is complete. 
15.	End the program.
